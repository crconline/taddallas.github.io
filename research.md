# Disease Ecology

 The majority of my research experience is on the ecology of infectious disease, using a _Daphnia_ -microparasite interaction as a model system to test epidemiological and ecological theory. This system is ideal, as the host is clonal (i.e., no genetic nonsense unless I want it there), fast-reproducing, and perfectly sized (i.e., hundreds upon hundereds can coexist in a few liters of water). Current investigations with this system are exploring the impact of interspecific competition on epidemic dynamics, temperature variability as an infection driver, and the relative impact of pathogen exposure on fitness of different host species (i.e., "costs of resistance").

# Metacommunity Ecology

One of the central goals of community ecology is to understand what shapes species distributions. Metacommunity theory aims to address this question by treating communities of organisms as nodes in a network, connected through dispersal. In my dissertation research (or distracting side projects), I examine the importance of spatial and environmental processes on metacommunity structure. I have developed the [metacom](http://github.com/taddallas/metacom) R package to help in this effort. Using this framework, I've addressed the factors responsible for structuring zooplankton communities in the northeast US, parasites of small desert mammals, and disease vectors across much of the southeast US. Examining parasite and vector distributions through this framework has some really clear benefits, which are too numerous to fit here.

# Population Ecology

Questions of population synchrony and stability in fluctuating environments have always interested me. What causes populations to crash, and can we predict population extinction? What is the frequency distribution of extinction times when populations are essentially identical? How does the environment influence this distribution? So many questions I would love to answer. I'm currently investigating how fluctuating temperature may increase population cycle amplitude, and how this alteration may impact the distribution of extinction times.

# Open Science

I build tools for [accessing](https://github.com/ropensci/parasiteR) and [analyzing](https://github.com/taddallas/metacom) ecological data. I also maintain an [open lab notebook](http://taddallas.github.io/LabNotebook/), and have been [interviewed by Georgia public radio](https://beta.prx.org/stories/138032) about Open Access publishing (John Drake and I are around the 15 minute mark). I try to be as open with my science as I can, but I still likely have lots of room for improvement. If you're interested in having an open labnotebook, I made a template to help make it easier. It's available [here](https://github.com/taddallas/LabNotebook/tree/sampleNotebook), along with _hopefully_ clear instructions on the file structure and how to use it. One of the nicest parts is that you don't have to worry about coding the `html` or downloading any software. You write posts in markdown, and Github/Jekyll creates the beautiful page for you. I welcome contributions to that project, or any of the other projects on [Github](https://github.com/taddallas).
