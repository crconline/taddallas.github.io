# Population Ecology

Questions of population synchrony and stability in fluctuating environments have always interested me. What causes populations to crash, and can we predict population extinction? What is the frequency distribution of extinction times when populations are maintained in constant environments, and how does this distribution change as a function of environmental variation? So many questions I would love to answer.

My current research examines spatial population dynamics of flour beetles, while much of my dissertation research focused on the population biology of infectious disease. For example, I have explored **1)** the costs of pathogen resistance and infection in a zooplankton model system, **2)** how environmental nitrate levels influence host-parasite interactions, and **3)** host density thresholds to pathogen invasion.

# Community Ecology

Scaling up from populations, I'm interested in the covariates associated with interactions between host and parasite communities. With a focus on prediction, I have addressed **1)** the predictability of host-parasite associations in partially observed interaction networks,  **2)** traits associated with hosts playing large roles in networks of parasite sharing, and **3)** the relative importance of geography, host traits, and the existing parasite community on the host community composition of fish parasites.

Together, this branch of my research combines network theory and disease ecology to uncover the factors underlying host-parasite associations. An understanding of these factors could lead to accurate prediction of the risk of parasite host-switching, which could identify hosts likely to transmit zoonotic parasites, or forecast the impact of host extinctions or introductions on parasite community structure.

# Metacommunity Ecology

One of the central goals of community ecology is to understand what shapes species distributions. Metacommunity theory aims to address this question by treating communities of organisms as nodes in a network, connected through dispersal. In my dissertation research (or distracting side projects), I examined the importance of spatial and environmental processes on metacommunity structure. Using the framework established by Leibold and Mikkelson (2002), I have addressed the factors responsible for structuring zooplankton communities in the northeast US, parasites of small desert mammals, and disease vectors across much of the southeast US. The application of this framework to host-parasite networks is not unlike the work described above, and simply offers a different lens through which to examine parasite community structure on host individuals or species.

# Open Science

I build tools for [accessing](https://github.com/ropensci/parasiteR) and [analyzing](https://github.com/taddallas/metacom) ecological data. I also maintain an [open lab notebook](http://taddallas.github.io/LabNotebook/), and have been [interviewed by Georgia public radio](https://beta.prx.org/stories/138032) about Open Access publishing (John Drake and I are around the 15 minute mark). Much of the data gathered as part of my dissertation is freely available, either through [Figshare](https://figshare.com/authors/Tad_Dallas/2585290) or as a supplement to published work (look for the database symbol next to publications on my `papers` page). Also, I have made a video of my dissertation defense [available here](https://figshare.com/articles/Dissertation_defense/3175594).  I try to be as open with my science as I can, but I still likely have lots of room for improvement.


If you're interested in having an open labnotebook, I made a template [available  here](https://github.com/taddallas/LabNotebook/tree/sampleNotebook), along with _hopefully_ clear instructions on the file structure and how to use it. One of the nicest parts is that you don't have to worry about coding the `html` or downloading any software. You write posts in markdown, and Github/Jekyll creates the beautiful page for you. I welcome contributions to that project, or any of the other projects on [Github](https://github.com/taddallas).
