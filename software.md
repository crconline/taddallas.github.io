`metacom` performs the Elements of Metacommunity Structure analysis. This analysis aims to classify metacommunites based on the combination of three statistics (coherence, turnover, and boundary clumping). The analysis is performed on site-by-species matrices depicting the distribution of species among sites, but can also be used to examine any similarly bipartite interaction (plant-pollinator, host-parasite, etc.).

`helminthR` allows for the programmatic access of London Natural History Museum's helminth database. This extensive database is composed of over 250,000 host-parasite occurrence records from all over the globe.

`rSpotify` is an R interface to Spotify's API. This is a completely just for fun project. It initially started as a joking conversation betwee Tom (our computer guru in the Drake lab) and myself, where I said it would be funny to have a Spotify app that calculates a "Nickelback number". This would be the number of steps along an undirected graph before you reach Nickelback, and would be a way to shame people for liking garbage music. It would also serve to shame people for being super pretentious. I stopped short of this goal, and settled for visualizing relationships between artists, with lots of help from the `networkD3` R package.

Feel free to [fork and contribute](https://github.com/ropensci/parasiteR/), or just steal the idea and make a Spotify App. After all, almost all of what I have done here is just utilizing the functionality added by other folks.
