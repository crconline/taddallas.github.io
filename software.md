# R packages for fun


## rSpotify &nbsp;  &nbsp;  <a href="https://github.com/taddallas/rSpotify"> <i style="color:HotPink" class="fa fa-github-alt"></i></a>
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/taddallas/rSpotify.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/taddallas/rSpotify)

`rSpotify` is an R interface to Spotify's API. This is a completely just for fun project. It initially started as a joking conversation betwee Tom (our computer guru in the Drake lab) and myself, where I said it would be funny to have a Spotify app that calculates a "Nickelback number". This would be the number of steps along an undirected graph before you reach Nickelback, and would be a way to shame people for liking garbage music. It would also serve to shame people for being super pretentious. I stopped short of this goal, and settled for visualizing relationships between artists, with lots of help from the `networkD3` R package.

Feel free to [fork and contribute](https://github.com/ropensci/parasiteR/), or just steal the idea and make a Spotify App. After all, almost all of what I have done here is just utilizing the functionality added by other folks.
